            "content": "Donald Trump told Fox News host Tucker Carlson a new version of one of his favorite old stories on Tuesday night. But it’s a story that hasn’t always turned out to be true. The former president claimed that employees in the New York courthouse where he was arraigned earlier this month were crying over him. Advertisement “They signed me in, and I’ll tell you, people were crying, people that work there, professionally work there, that have no problems putting in murderers and they see everybody,” he told Carlson. “It’s a tough, tough place, and they were crying. They were actually crying. They said, ‘I’m sorry.’” So people who work at the courthouse were crying and saying “2024 sir” pic.twitter.com/KNgbpATDtN — Acyn (@Acyn) April 12, 2023 Trump told Carlson ― a confessed liar who admitted that he hates Trump “passionately” in private messages ― that the people in the courthouse were also saying “2024, sir, 2024” to him. “Tears were pouring down their eyes,” Trump claimed. “I’ve never seen anything like that.” Yet Trump has frequently claimed to have seen exactly that: people who are reduced to tears in his presence, especially “tough guys” who had never cried until they were overcome upon meeting him . Advertisement Those stories haven’t always been backed by evidence, such as a claim that farmers and ranchers wept behind him as he spoke at an event in 2017. The video from his speech that day shows no sign of tears . Related Donald Trump Fox News tucker carlson Donald Trump Boasted About Making Farmers Cry With Joy. You Be The Judge.

            "description": "The fictional son of Lucy and Ricky Ricardo was making bank. Keith Thibodeaux, the actor who played Little Ricky, landed the role after earning $500/week as a drummer.",
            "content": "Keith Thibodeaux, then billed as Richard Keith, landed the role of Little Ricky in I Love Lucy at the ripe old age of five. A drumming prodigy, Thibodeaux beat out 200 or more child actors to become the fictional son of Lucy and Ricky Ricardo . He went on to appear in over 20 episodes of the iconic series and several of its spinoffs. Believe it or not, it wasn’t his first brush with fame. Thibodeaux was already a veteran employee when I Love Lucy came around. In fact, he was making $500 per week by the age of three. Thibodeaux was just three years old when he auditioned for The Horace Heidt Show as a drummer, the acclaimed musician told the Television Academy in an interview. Thibodeaux explained that he was initially turned down, with Heidt telling his father that the show didn’t need a three-year-old drummer because they already had a 12-year-old drummer. That wasn’t the final word. Thibodeaux recalled that two weeks later, he was hired and spent time traversing the country with a full orchestra. His father quit his job with a gas company to accompany his then-toddler son on gigs. For his time, Thibodeaux reportedly earned $500 per week, the equivalent of over $5,000 per week today. Keith Thibodeaux wasn’t an actor when he auditioned for I Love Lucy . Thibodeaux was only five years old, and it didn’t look like he’d beat out other, more seasoned child stars for the role. As it turned out, Thibodeaux had something the other kids didn’t have. He could play the drums. In 2015, Thibodeaux sat down with ABC News and recalled the audition process for I Love Lucy . He explained that Lucille Ball specifically asked his father what he did, and when he insisted he played the drums, Ball was astonished. The Little Ricky actor recalled the feisty redhead saying that she couldn’t believe that. He sat down at a drum set, and the rest was history. Desi Arnaz exclaimed that they had found their “little Ricky” on the spot. Thibodeaux had an acting career after I Love Lucy ended, too. He went on to appear in The Andy Griffith Show , portraying Opie Taylor’s friend . He appeared in 13 episodes of the series. Eventually, Thibodeaux returned to a normal childhood, leaving Hollywood behind. He went back to his hometown and enrolled in a local high school, where he led a pretty quiet life. After high school, he worked his way back to show business, but not to the small-screen. Thibodeaux took his musical talents on tour with David and the Giants. He would leave and rejoin the band twice over the years. He is currently working with them again. Thibodeaux has served as the Christian rock band’s drummer again since 2007. They released their most recent album, What Are You Waiting For? , in 2019. Thibodeaux is involved in other performing arts avenues, too. He helped found a dance company with his wife, Kathy Denton, an acclaimed ballet dancer. The company, Ballet Magnificat!, was founded in 1986. In 1994, Thibodeaux shared his story of growing up around Lucille Ball and Dezi Arnaz in his autobiography, Life After Lucy .",

            "description": "Kirsten Dunst once shared there was a long stretch while filming ‘Spider-Man 3’ where the film had her in low spirits.",
            "content": "The Spider-Man franchise was a huge part of actor Kirsten Dunst’s life and career . But filming the iconic superhero series wasn’t always a good time for the superstar. Dunst was already an established actor by the time she brought Mary Jane Watson to the big screen. It was a part she was initially attracted to because of the depth she saw in the role. But Dunst wanted to add even more depth, and made it clear to director Sam Raimi that she wasn’t going to be solely a victim to be saved. “’I just don’t want to be the damsel in distress. I’ll scream on the balcony, but you’ve got to let me do a little action here,’” she remembered telling Raimi in a resurfaced interview with CNN . But even after clinching the feature, there were certain physical scenes that Dunst didn’t take a liking to. So she simply refused to do them no matter how much she was pressured into changing her mind. “I’ve always said ‘no.’ Like, it’s my life, you know? I remember once with Spider-Man , they kept at me with this one stunt where they strung me to the top of the ceiling and basically I bungee jumped,” Dunst once said according to Cinemablend . “I didn’t really want to do it, and when I tried it I said, ‘Well, you should’ve shot that because I’m never doing it again. You’ll have to find another way’. It was terrifying, I hated it – so you should’ve shot that because I will never do it again.” Dunst isn’t a fan of doing action scenes. But perhaps what she can’t stand more than doing certain stunts is doing nothing at all while on set. There was a lot of that for Dunst in Spider-Man 3 , which bored the actor out of her mind. “As it came to the end of our film, it was like this three-week period of sitting in the trailer, just zoned out on MTV,” she once said in an interview with MTV News . “It was like [ My Super ] Sweet 16 ; I was dying in my trailer. Occasionally, we’d do a shot and it [lasts] the blink of an eye in the film. It’s really arduous and depressing.” Fortunately, Dunst had a friend in the entertainment industry who had similar feelings towards their job at the time. Dunst and her friend were able to vent about their work experiences together. “I actually remember my best friend was living with me — she works for MTV; she casts reality shows for you guys. She’d come home super-bored, depressed from her job, and I’d come home depressed from mine. We’d drink pinot grigio and watch American Idol and be like, ‘I hate our lives!’ For three weeks, we had the worst time,” she said. Dunst has been immortalized as a permanent part of Spider-Man mythology. Still, it’s been a while since she’s portrayed her live action Mary Jane Watson in any Spider-Man movies. The franchise has since moved on to include a new generation of actors that has featured the likes of Zendaya and Tom Holland. When asked about her thoughts about the new Spider-Man films, however, Dunst didn’t mince words. “I don’t care,” she said in a 2017 Variety interview. “Everyone likes our Spider-Man . C’mon, am I right or what? Listen, I’d rather be in the first ones than the new ones.” If she had one major regret about her own franchise, it was that she didn’t continue her story where it was left off in Spider-Man 3 . “I wanted to be in that movie so badly,” Dunst said. “I loved it, and I wish we could have made a fourth .”",

            "content": "close Video Donald Trump on arraignment: They're 'weaponizing the system' Former President Donald Trump reflects on his arraignment, Biden's withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Russia-Ukraine war and more on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' Former President Donald Trump sounded off on Democratic prosecutors investigating and lodging legal cases against him as he runs for the White House, telling \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" in an exclusive interview Tuesday he would not drop of the presidential race if he is convicted. Trump accused the left of relying on tactics from the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) to stop him. Host Tucker Carlson noted Democrats like New York County District Attorney Alvin Bragg appear to be trying to prevent Trump from making it to the general election by tying him up in lawsuits and charging him with crimes: \"The old Soviet process,\" Trump replied, appearing to reference the mantra credited to Soviet Internal Affairs Minister Lavrentiy Beria: \"Show me the man, I'll show you the crime.\" \"It's so off, the statute of limitations are years off,\" he said, echoing critiques of legal scholars who have analyzed Bragg's indictment. Trump vowed he would \"never drop out\" if convicted. WH FACES BACKLASH FROM VETS OVER AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL REPORT \"It's not my thing, I wouldn't do it,\" he told Carlson. Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin (1879-1953) seen in 1949 (Keystone/Getty Images) Trump added that while many Democrats call him \"terrible\" and \"guilty,\" there have been some who have surprised him by asserting he is innocent. \"I think it was Andrew McCabe, the FBI [assistant director] who I fired. He came out. He said 'they've got no case'.\" He added that there have been other less-partisan legal scholars who essentially echo his innocence or the assertion Bragg has no case. The former president pointed to former New York federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy, George Washington University Prof. Jonathan Turley and Harvard Law professor-emeritus Alan Dershowitz, calling them \"down-the-middle people.\" \"Think of it, Tucker. I've been through seven years of investigations,\" he said, adding that after Democrats ultimately were successful in acquiring years of his tax returns, they could find little in dispute. TRUMP TELLS TUCKER HE HAS DOUBTS ABOUT BIDEN SEEKING RE-ELECTION: 'SOMETHING WRONG' Video The former president, however, added he disagreed with a court ruling that ultimately awarded the records to Rep. Richie Neal, D-Mass. Trump said that in what he estimated to be millions of pages of documents throughout all investigations to-date, his detractors have found next to nothing to pin on him, leading them to feel they need to charge him as Bragg has. \"Think of this: So you have all of these millions and millions of pages, and they get you on a nondisclosure agreement,\" Trump said, appearing to refer to the payment agreement made by his fixer-turned-foil Michael Cohen to porn actress Stormy Daniels. WHITE HOUSE TORCHED OVER PENTAGON LEAKS AS DEMOCRATS CONDEMN TRUMP OVER MAR-A-LAGO FINDS Video \"I mean, big numbers, billions and billions of dollars, and they get you on a perfect nondisclosure agreement where they get you and nothing,\" he said. \"A friend of mine who's a big business guy said, 'You have to be the most honest guy in the world, because with all of those numbers that you have, in those big numbers, they don't have anything'.\" Trump also spoke at length about President Biden, whom he hopes to defeat in a 2024 rematch. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Video He questioned Biden's competency and ability to govern, saying that critiques of the president's age are not entirely the right tact. Trump said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is older than Biden but much sharper, and that his friend and Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus is 93 and still \"smart as hell.\" Trump said he had a meeting with Marcus several months ago and characterized him as \"100%\" compared to Biden. He said Biden's purported shortcomings were on display during a softball interview with NBC meteorologist Al Roker on Monday.",

The Austin City Council will be briefed next week on the agreement and its impact on public safety in the Texas state capital . Council member Mackenzie Kelly, a volunteer firefighter and staunch public safety advocate, sent a memo to the interim city manager ahead of that briefing, requesting information on the numbers of arrests, gun seizures, and searches that Texas DPS has been responsible for. \"I deem it crucial for the community to comprehend the commendable efforts of both APD and DPS in their collaborative initiative,\" Kelly wrote in the memo. \"Thus, during the briefing, I request that we are informed of specific instances of such work.\" A Texas state trooper walks through the rotunda of the Texas State Capitol in Austin.

'HUGE' PARTS OF AUSTIN LEFT 'UNPOLICED' AFTER CITY CONTRACT FIGHT TRIGGERS MASS OFFICER EXODUS Last month, Lacey Purciful was driving with her husband and two children when a suspected drunk driver cut across two lanes of traffic and slammed into them head-on. The family called 911 five times, but it took two-and-a-half hours for an officer to show up, at which point the driver had sobered up and was able to avoid charges. \"I think the partnership was long overdue and is paying immediate dividends. I used to regularly hear from clients about APD not showing up to car crashes for hours - including most notably in the Purciful case. This was due to the staffing shortage,\" Loewy told Fox News Digital on Tuesday. \"That has changed once DPS started patrols. There are now close to enough law enforcement personnel to respond to calls and enforce the laws.\" An Austin Police Department officer on patrol. (Nick Tre. Smith/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) Mayor Kirk Watson said on March 27 that state troopers and DPS special agents would focus on traffic stops and combating violent crime . The partnership has yielded 300 traffic stops and 16 arrests per day so far, according to the Austin American-Statesman. While the additional law enforcement presence has been welcomed by many, other city officials have criticized the secretive way that it was negotiated. \"Austinties deserve accountability and transparency,\" Council member Vanessa Fuentes tweeted this week. \"There's no use in setting high standards for local officers if they can easily be bypassed with an increased presence of State Troopers. They must, at least, adhere to the same rules and standards as their local counterparts.\" AUSTIN POLICE DEPARTMENT TURNS TO AI AS STAFFING CRISIS LOOMS Council member Zo Qadri accused state police of showing \"a lack of accountability, transparency and concern.\" \"DPS has no business patrolling Austin and making so many of our communities feel unsafe,\" Qadri tweeted.

(Spencer Selvidge for The Washington Post via Getty Images) Austin police's staffing crisis stretches back years, but the problem was exacerbated by the city council's decision to cut the department's budget by about a third in August 2020. That funding was restored the next year, but multiple cadet classes had already been canceled and officers left in droves.

Suffolk County District Attorney Raymond A. Tierney announced that Angela Pollina, 45, was sentenced after a jury found her guilty last month of second-degree murder and four counts of endangering the welfare of a child. Angela Pollina was found guilty by a jury in the second-degree murder of her 8-year-old autistic stepson, who was forced to sleep in an unheated garage in freezing temps.

In those messages, Pollina insisted Thomas and Anthony sleep in the garage of their Center Moriches home and not be allowed to use the bathrooms inside. NYPD OFFICER CHARGED WITH MURDER IN DEATH OF AUTISTIC SON, 8, ON LONG ISLAND For months, the boys slept in the garage without blankets, according to the DA, and the night before Thomas died, he and his brother had been in the garage for 16 hours after returning home from school. The DA said that night, there was no heat in the garage, the boys had no access to bathrooms, no blankets and no mattress, and the temperature outside was 19 degrees.

FORMER NYPD COP SENTENCED TO 25 YEARS FOR MURDER OF 8-YEAR-OLD SON Two hours before Thomas died, Pollina was captured on surveillance footage hosing him down in the backyard with water – he died of hypothermia. The two boys lived with another brother, their father, Pollina and her three daughters beginning in 2017. Employees at the East Moriches School District testified in court that Thomas and Anthony appeared thin, ate food off the floor, took food from other students and pulled partially eaten food from the garbage cans. When the boys arrived at school, employees reportedly smelled the urine and feces on them. Pollina took the stand during the trial and said she deleted surveillance footage and did not realize making the two boys live in the garage in freezing temperatures was wrong until Thomas died.

            "description": "An explosive new book is offering fresh details on why the Duchess of Sussex reportedly wasn't part of the Sandringham Summit.",
            "content": "Many royal watchers remember where they were when they heard that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were stepping back from their roles as working royals. But it wasn’t just fans who were shocked by the news, it seemed that Queen Elizabeth II was caught by surprise as well and that’s why she called for a historic royal summit. According to an explosive new book, the Duke of Sussex took part in the summit without his wife because Prince William and now-King Charles didn’t trust the duchess. On Jan. 13, 2020, just days after the Sussexes announced their decision to step down , the queen called for a summit. The late monarch summoned then-Prince Charles, Prince William, and Prince Harry to her Sandringham residence in what became known as the Sandringham Summit. Meghan, however, was not in the U.K. at the time but was expected to dial into the summit via video from Canada and join the family discussion. But that didn’t happen. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson later said that Meghan and Harry ultimately decided that it “wasn’t necessary” for her to do so. Royal author and historian Robert Jobson claims that the real reason Meghan didn’t call in is because Harry’s father and brother didn’t trust her. In his book Our King Charles III — The Man And The Monarch Revealed , Jobson reports that Charles and William feared others could listen in to Meghan’s video link or she would leak parts of their conversation. “There was a suggestion that Meghan should join Charles, William, and Harry via video link from Canada, but the queen ruled that her attendance in any form was ‘not necessary’ as Harry would represent her,” Jobson wrote per Express , adding, “It was also felt that a video link wouldn’t be secure, as Charles and William wouldn’t be able to tell if the meeting was being recorded or if Meghan had anyone else listening in as they spoke.” Following the summit, Queen Elizabeth released a statement that read: “Today my family had very constructive discussions on the future of my grandson and his family. My family and I are entirely supportive of Harry and Meghan’s desire to create a new life as a young family. Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working members of the royal family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent life as a family while remaining a valued part of my family.” In the fifth episode of Sussexes’ Netflix docuseries Harry & Meghan , the duchess spoke about not being part of the Sandringham Summit saying: “Imagine a conversation, a roundtable discussion about the future of your life. When the stakes are this high. And you as the mom and the wife and the target, in many regards, aren’t invited to have a seat at the table.” The prince then gave his side of what went on during the summit and how he was feeling. “It was terrifying to have my brother scream and shout at me and have my father say things that simply weren’t true, and my grandmother sit there and sort of take it all in,” the duke said. King Charles and Prince William have not responded to Harry’s claims.",
